  <h1>Radicle Platform</h1>
  <h2>Decentralized code collaboration</h2>
  <p>Radicle is a decentralized code collaboration network built on open protocols 🌱. It enables developers to collaborate on code without relying on trusted intermediaries. Radicle was designed to provide similar functionality to centralized code collaboration platforms — or "forges" — while retaining Git’s peer-to-peer nature, building on what made distributed version control so powerful in the first place.</p>
  <p>The Radicle network is powered by a peer-to-peer replication protocol built on Git, called Radicle Link. Radicle Link extends Git with peer-to-peer discovery by disseminating data via a process called gossip. That is, participants in the network share and spread data they are "interested" in by keeping redundant copies locally and sharing, otherwise known as "replicating", their local data with selected peers. By leveraging Git's smart transfer protocol, Radicle Link keeps Git's efficiency when it comes to data replication while offering global decentralized repository storage through the peer-to-peer networking layer.</p>
  <p>Since all data on the network is stored locally by peers on the network, developers can share and collaborate on Git repositories without relying on intermediaries such as hosted servers.</p>
  <h2>How Bankless will use Radicle</h2>
  <p>Currently, Bankless uses GitHub to house all our development projects and for code collaboration. For obvious (M$ 👎) reasons, this is not ideal while promoting the principles of decentralization. Our goal is to eventually move all of bDAO's development projects over to Radicle. This will allow us to:
  <ul>
    <li>Truly own our DAO's code without reliance on central intermediaries</li>
    <li>Run our own seed nodes and incentivizing operators for providing security</li>
    <li>Actively demonstrate and promote the core principles of decentralization</li>
    <li>Encourage collaborators to participate in the decentralized ecosystem</li>
  </ul>
